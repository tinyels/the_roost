commits indicate iterative steps of adding bootstrap enhancements to pages:

Step 0 base html with images and text from wikipedia
step 1 add one simple css class to reduce cut and paste (class named small)
step 2 add bootstrap and jquery meta tags (show changes to layout)
step 3 make images circular on index (add class named img-circle to images)
step 4 put images in rows (each row in a div.class and add .span6 to li's)
step 5  add hero-unit (not centered!)
step 6 add container (breaks rows, so switch to span4 and thumbnail, add more complicated layout to each li)
step 7 add nav bar to both
step 8 add layout to buckeye
step 9 added layout   (row-fluid, span)
step 10 final touches (table and polaroid)
